## Cybersecurity

It is the practice of ensuring **confidentiality, integrity and availability** of information by protecting network, devices, people and data from unauthorized access and criminal exploitation.

A **threat actor** is any person or group that presents a security risk.

Security protects us from _internal_ and _external_ threats. An **internal threat** is posed by current or former employees, external vendors or trusted partners (basically, from anyone associated with the organization). An **external threat** is from someone outside the organization trying to gain access to private information, networks, or devices.

Often, the internal threats are accidental, such as an employee clicking on a compromized link in an email. Nonetheless, they may be intentional as well, such as an internal actor trying to gain unauthorized access to some data or abusing systems for personal use.

Security teams also ensure compliance with regulations and laws that may require implementation of certain security standards. This prevents organizations from fines and other charges, while allowing them to satisfy their ethical obligation to protect their users.
