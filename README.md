## Cybersecurity

It is the practice of ensuring **confidentiality, integrity and availability** of information by protecting network, devices, people and data from unauthorized access and criminal exploitation.

A **threat actor** is any person or group that presents a security risk.

Security protects us from _internal_ and _external_ threats. An **internal threat** is posed by current or former employees, external vendors or trusted partners (basically, from anyone associated with the organization). An **external threat** is from someone outside the organization trying to gain access to private information, networks, or devices.
